When droughts destroy the crops of farmers in Mozambique, some turn to the forest for an alternative source of income. This paper uses geospatial data to measure that relationship, and finds that low rainfall is associated with greater forest loss in areas where humans live, but not where they don't (suggesting this is a human-caused phenomenon).
