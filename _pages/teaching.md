I will be teaching a Masters level course in Development Economics Fall 2019 at the University of San Francisco. Come visit this page again after August to see the syllabus and learn more about the course.

At UC Davis, I was a teaching assistant for Environmental Economics (ARE 176) with Jonathan Kaplan. During my Masters studies at University of British Columba, I was a teaching assistant for Wealth and Poverty of Nations (ECON 234) and Principles of Microeconomics (ECON 101).

My first teaching experience was working with my Uncle Larry as an archery instructor at [Salt Lake Archery](http://www.slarchery.com/). The lessons I learned from Larry and my students there continue to inform my teaching.
