I am a development and environmental economist studying how people cope with droughts, floods, and other environmental shocks. I am particularly interested in how household
power structures lead the costs of those shocks to be unevenly distributed.

Before starting my PhD, I lived and worked for several years in Mozambique studying climate smart agriculture. Prior to that, I worked on renewable energy and energy efficiency policy in the U.S., Germany, and China.
