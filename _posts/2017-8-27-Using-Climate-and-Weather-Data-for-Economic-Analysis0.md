title:  "Using Climate and Weather Data for Economic Analysis"
---

I prepared a [slide deck](http://hobbservations.com/WeatherData) for my Environmental Economics class based on a very useful [paper by Auffhammer, Hsiang, Schlenker, and Sobel](https://academic.oup.com/reep/article-abstract/7/2/181/1522753/Using-Weather-Data-and-Climate-Model-Output-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext). I'm posting the slides here so they can be used as a quick reference for myself and others when it comes time to use these data.
